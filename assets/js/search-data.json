            "content": "State-space Models (SSMs) . State-space models (SSMs) are useful in better predicting “true” values of a time series. They work by using simulations to make estimates through process and measurement equations. They are useful for inferring better tracks and hidden processes (i.e. behaviour), particularly when using less accurate data (e.g. Argos locations) and/or in the marine environment. A major limitation of using them is that they are hard to validate. Dr. Marie Auger-Méthé has recorded a helpful seminar (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS5xzcmhpW0) and written a review that is especially targeted towards students wanting to use SSMs: “A guide to state-space modeling of ecological time series” (Auger-Méthé et al. 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02001). There are R tutorials included on how to fit SSMs and validate these models (our tutorial worked through Appendix 1). .",

            "content": "Discussion of movement ecology framework paper  . Over the last decades the study of movement ecology has faced many challenges, including the separation of animal movement research into taxonomic groups, lack of synthesis from different geographical regions and methodologies and sampling designs. Additionally, a unified framework for movement ecology studies was missing. With the aim to unify movement studies under a common conceptual framework, Nathan et al. 2008 proposed a movement ecology paradigm based on principle components of animal and plant movement. This includes how the organism moves, when and towards what destination the movement occurs, why the organism moves and the interaction of these components. Establishing a unified theoretical framework for animal movement studies, that synthesizes different aspects of individual movement and general theory of animal movement research has resulted in a well-known and well-cited manuscript which provides a great baseline for anyone interested in animal movement ecology.  .

An animal’s ability to navigate long distances and revisit exact locations is a remarkable thing. For this meeting we dove into the world of homing pigeons to try to learn more about this unsolved mystery. This charming documentary going on comedy follows four main schools of thought behind the pigeons incredible homing ability. The documentary features a rag tag bunch of scientists, pigeon fanciers and a mysterious egg that continues to slowly crack, much like some of the characters in the film. We are presented with four competing hypothesis to explain pigeon navigation: a) pigeons find their way by olfactory cues, b) sight and landmarks is what helps pigeons find their way, c) pigeons have an ability to detect Earth’s magnetic fields and navigate via some kind of internal compass or d) the real explanation is ‘morphic resonance’ a sort of voodoo sixth sense that animals have for their homes that acts like an elastic band that brings them back to places they love. To find out which hypothesis stacks up the most and who gets egg on their face you can watch the documentary here and marvel at their accents and admiration for pigeons: . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfM8aN7RDNc .",

Our group is made up of people across diverse disciplines, academic qualifications, gender, cultural backgrounds, and expertise. We are interested in a wide variety of animal movement topics in a manifold of ecosystems and taxa, including crustaceans, fish, birds, mammals, and reptiles. . ROAM was founded and is currently led by Kyana Pike and Emily Webster, with the invigorating collaboration of ROAM members. . We meet every second Tuesday at noon using a mixed virtual and in-person format. . Who we are . Emily Webster . Email Linkedin . Emily is in the second year of her PhD at James Cook University. She is interested in behaviour and survival of wildlife living in human-dominated land and seascapes. In her Honours research, she studied colonially-breeding wetland birds with GPS-GSM telemetry. She examined their foraging strategies and reproductive success in relation to environmental flows delivered from upstream dams and weirs. Her PhD is part of a long-term mutli-disciplinary collaborative monitoring program. She is working on increasing understanding of fine-scale habitat use by resident green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in industrial inshore foraging grounds with satellite telemetry. She hopes that this information will help to elucidate the risks of human-turtle interactions and inform management options for this protected species. . Kyana Pike . Twitter Email . Kyana is a PhD candidate at James Cook University researching the interaction between giant tortoises and agriculture in the Galapagos. Since 2018, Kyana has been collaborating with the Giant Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme (http://gianttortoise.org/en/) to leverage fine scale GPS tracking data to delve into temporal and spatial patterns of farm use by tortoises. She has used movement analysis tools such as occurrence distributions, home range estimators and integrated step selection functions to better understand tortoise use of farmland. These results can then help to provide evidence-based recommendations on how to balance the needs of tortoises and farmers in the Galapagos. . Saúl González . Email . Saúl González Murcia is conducting his PhD at James Cook University studying ecological aspects of sponges and corals and how those interactions affect reef associated fishes. As parallel projects he is assessing movement patterns of intertidal and freshwater fishes in El Salvador. Fishes are a central interest in his research and currently he is trying to determine small scale and daily movement patterns for resident and opportunist intertidal fishes. In freshwater ecosystems his research aims to determine movement patterns of predator fishes and their preys and potential responses that freshwater fishes could have on their movement pattern in the presence of introduced species. . Donald McKnight . Twitter . Donald works primarily on freshwater and terrestrial turtles and studies home ranges, habitat use, movements among wetlands within meta-populations, and movements as they relate to social behavior. This research is predominantly conservation-focused and includes work on critically endangered species such as the Central American River Turtle (Dermatemys mawii). He is involved in projects from around the world, including research in Australia, the United States of America, and Belize. . César Herrera . Twitter GitHub Email . César&#39;s interests are spatial ecology, animal movement, biodiversity patterns, ecosystem functioning, probabilistic programming, and Computer Vision. . Michael Taylor . Twitter Email . Mike is a PhD student at The University of Western Australia studying ecological links between large marine megafauna and their environment. Working mainly in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, Mike collaborates with the the Malgana traditional owners of Gathaagudu (Shark Bay) to deploy satellite tags on seagrass loving green turtles and dugongs. The long-term tracks collected from these animals can then be used to understand seasonal and diel variation in movement, estimate home ranges and habitat use, and in understanding how climate change will impact these at risk populations . Nicolas Lubitz . . Nicolas works on movement drivers in animals, using sharks and rays as a case study. He is developing a context-based framework to analysing animal movement data that considers individual and geographical variability in movement behaviour. For example, some individuals of a species make large-scale movements while others do not. While this appears to add a lot of complexity to the question at hand, it actually can help us tease apart why movement occurs in the first place. He is tagging bull sharks in Australia, South Africa and Florida with acoustic and satellite transmitters to track their movements and identify how environmental factors, prey availability, individual reproductive behaviour and genetics influence movement strategies. . Michelle Perez . Email . Michelle recently graduated from James Cook University with a Master of Science (Professional) in Marine Biology. In this program she undertook a minor research project investigating the post-nesting migration patterns of loggerhead turtles from Queensland rookeries using GPS tracking and flipper tag (capture-mark-recapture) data. She is now a Research Worker with JCU examining the spatial use of inter-nesting green turtles at Raine Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR). This work includes the use of home range estimators and analysing fine-scale movement patterns to better understand the relationships between movement, habitat use, and reproductive success of the endangered nGBR stock of green turtles. . Kevin Crook . Twitter . Kevin’s research focuses on understanding the consequences of fine-scale animal movement and behaviour for ecosystem function. To do this, he has developed novel sampling methods, pairing active acoustic telemetry with drone tracking to place behaviour observations within the context of diurnal movement patterns. Using stingrays on coastal sandflats as a model study system, his research has identified fine-scale foraging habitat partitioning among sympatric stingrays that would otherwise have been hidden using habitat use estimates from traditional tracking methods alone. Although his research focuses primarily on stingrays, Kevin is also involved in movement studies on estuarine fish and sharks. . Rebecca Diggins . Twitter Email . Rebecca is a James Cook University (JCU) PhD candidate from the UK who is studying sea turtle movement as it relates to conservation outcomes. She has been working with the JCU Turtle Health Research group since 2016 and is currently tracking captive-raised, juvenile hawksbill turtles that were recently released into the wild. The aim of this work is to monitor the behaviour on release and subsequent dispersal of the turtles around the reef to inform best practice for release of juvenile turtles in future. Her research also looks at how the satellite trackers themselves affect the behaviour of the turtles. .",
