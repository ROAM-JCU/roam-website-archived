Please notice that when using a Word document there is less flexibility than when using a Markdown document or a Jupyter Notebook. . Please remember to use the name convention for all posts. This means you Word document should be named: | YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.docx . You can include titles and links in your document. | A title heading 1 . A title heading 2 .

            "content": "The process of using two different home range estimators on the same dataset, as we did in our last session, highlighted the real possibility of obtaining different results, and therefore different conclusions for the same data. This raised the important question about the consequences of using different methods when applying these estimates to decision making, for instance conservation. To continue the discussion on this idea, we asked you to read the paper by the authors of the AKDE function and CTMM package who delve into this topic with a more in-depth comparison of this situation and what that might mean on the ground. .

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown.

          "content": "ROAM is the research on animal movement group at James Cook University. Our group is made of a diverse group of people across several disciplines, academic qualifications, gender, cultural backgrounds, and expertise. We are interested in a wide variety of matters associated to movement of animals in a manifold of ecosystems and taxa, including crustaceans, fish, birds, mammals, and reptiles. . ROAM was founded and is currently lead by Kyana Pike and Emily Webster, with the invigorating collaboration of ROAM members. . We meet every second Tuesday at noon using a mix virtual and presential format. . Who we are . Emily Webster . Email Linkedin . Emily is in the second year of her PhD at James Cook University. She is interested in behaviour and survival of wildlife living in human-dominated land and seascapes. In her Honours research, she studied colonially-breeding wetland birds with GPS-GSM telemetry. She examined their foraging strategies and reproductive success in relation to environmental flows delivered from upstream dams and weirs. Her PhD is part of a long-term mutli-disciplinary collaborative monitoring program. She is working on increasing understanding of fine-scale habitat use by resident green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in industrial inshore foraging grounds with satellite telemetry. She hopes that this information will help to elucidate the risks of human-turtle interactions and inform management options for this protected species. . Kyana Pike . Twitter Email . Kyana is a PhD candidate at James Cook University researching the interaction between giant tortoises and agriculture in the Galapagos. Since 2018, Kyana has been collaborating with the Giant Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme (http://gianttortoise.org/en/) to leverage fine scale GPS tracking data to delve into temporal and spatial patterns of farm use by tortoises. She has used movement analysis tools such as occurrence distributions, home range estimators and integrated step selection functions to better understand tortoise use of farmland. These results can then help to provide evidence-based recommendations on how to balance the needs of tortoises and farmers in the Galapagos. . Saúl González . Email . Saúl González Murcia is conducting his PhD at James Cook University studying ecological aspects of sponges and corals and how those interactions affect reef associated fishes. As parallel projects he is assessing movement patterns of intertidal and freshwater fishes in El Salvador. Fishes are a central interest in his research and currently he is trying to determine small scale and daily movement patterns for resident and opportunist intertidal fishes. In freshwater ecosystems his research aims to determine movement patterns of predator fishes and their preys and potential responses that freshwater fishes could have on their movement pattern in the presence of introduced species. . Donald McKnight . Twitter . Donald works primarily on freshwater and terrestrial turtles and studies home ranges, habitat use, movements among wetlands within meta-populations, and movements as they relate to social behavior. This research is predominantly conservation-focused and includes work on critically endangered species such as the Central American River Turtle (Dermatemys mawii). He is involved in projects from around the world, including research in Australia, the United States of America, and Belize. . César Herrera . Twitter GitHub Email .
