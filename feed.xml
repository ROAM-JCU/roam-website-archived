This raised the important question about the consequences of using different methods when applying these estimates to decision making, for instance conservation. To continue the discussion on this idea, we asked you to read the paper by the authors of the AKDE function and CTMM package who delve into this topic with a more in-depth comparison of this situation and what that might mean on the ground.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Diving into 3rd-gen space use estimators</title><link href="https://roam-jcu.github.io/roam-website/space-use/2021/06/22/diving-into-3rd-gen-space-use-estimators.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Diving into 3rd-gen space use estimators" /><published>2021-06-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-06-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://roam-jcu.github.io/roam-website/space-use/2021/06/22/diving-into-3rd-gen-space-use-estimators</id><author><name></name></author><category term="space-use" /><summary type="html">A corollary from our last meeting is that many methods for estimating space use are static and do not account for spatial or temporal autocorrelation in the data. For this reason, we were interested in learning a bit more about two of the third-generation space use estimators: the Movement-based Kernel Density Estimate (MKDE) and the Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimate (AKDE). Both are based on similar principles of applying a movement model to our location data as the first step in generating a utilization distribution. In this meeting we worked through an example of each of these with Kyanaâ€™s tortoise data in R.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Space-use estimators</title><link href="https://roam-jcu.github.io/roam-website/space-use/2021/06/08/space-use-estimators.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Space-use estimators" /><published>2021-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://roam-jcu.github.io/roam-website/space-use/2021/06/08/space-use-estimators</id><author><name></name></author><category term="space-use" /><summary type="html">Thank you to everyone who presented at our meeting on space-use estimators.</summary></entry></feed>
