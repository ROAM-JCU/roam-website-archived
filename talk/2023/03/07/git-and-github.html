<p>Wytamma gave a talk about git and github. Here are the slides <a href="/roam-website/images/git-github-roam.pdf">git-github-roam.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It provides a way for multiple developers to work together on a project, keeping track of changes and collaborating in a more organized and efficient way.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to using GitHub for collaboration:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a GitHub account: If you haven’t done so already, create a GitHub account at github.com.</li>
  <li>Create a repository: A repository is where your project will live on GitHub. To create a new repository, click on the “New” button on the GitHub home page and fill in the necessary information, such as the name and description of the repository.</li>
  <li>Invite collaborators: Once you’ve created a repository, you can invite other users to collaborate on the project. To do this, go to the repository’s settings page and click on the “Collaborators” tab. Enter the GitHub usernames of the people you want to invite, and they will receive an email notification.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository: To work on the project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. To do this, go to the repository’s page on GitHub and click on the “Code” button. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL and use it to clone the repository using Git on your local machine.</li>
  <li>Make changes: Once you’ve cloned the repository, you can make changes to the project files. Use Git to track your changes and commit them to the repository as you work.</li>
  <li>Push changes: Once you’ve made changes to the project, push them to the GitHub repository using Git. This will upload your changes to GitHub and make them available to your collaborators.</li>
  <li>Review changes: When one of your collaborators makes changes to the project, you can review them using GitHub’s pull request feature. This allows you to see the changes, leave comments, and merge them into the main branch of the repository if you approve.</li>
  <li>Resolve conflicts: If multiple people make changes to the same file at the same time, there may be conflicts that need to be resolved. GitHub provides tools to help you resolve conflicts and merge changes together.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, GitHub is a powerful tool for collaborative software development. By following these steps, you can work more efficiently with your team and ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to project changes and updates.</p>
