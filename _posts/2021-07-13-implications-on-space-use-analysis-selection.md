title: Implications of selecting home range estimators
---

The process of using two different home range estimators on the same dataset, as we did in our last session, highlighted the real possibility of obtaining different results, and therefore different conclusions for the same data. This raised the important question about the consequences of using different methods when applying these estimates to decision making, for instance conservation. To continue the discussion on this idea, we asked you to read the paper by the authors of the AKDE function and CTMM package who delve into this topic with a more in-depth comparison of this situation and what that might mean on the ground.
