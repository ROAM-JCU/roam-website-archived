The documentary features a rag tag bunch of scientists, pigeon fanciers and a mysterious egg that continues to slowly crack, much like some of the characters in the film. We are presented with four competing hypothesis to explain pigeon navigation: a) pigeons find their way by olfactory cues, b) sight and landmarks is what helps pigeons find their way, c) pigeons have an ability to detect Earth’s magnetic fields and navigate via some kind of internal compass or d) the real explanation is ‘morphic resonance’ a sort of voodoo sixth sense that animals have for their homes that acts like an elastic band that brings them back to places they love.
