    <p>Over the last decades the study of movement ecology has faced many challenges, including the separation of animal movement research into taxonomic groups, lack of synthesis from different geographical regions and methodologies and sampling designs. Additionally, a unified framework for movement ecology studies was missing. With the aim to unify movement studies under a common conceptual framework, Nathan et al. 2008 proposed a movement ecology paradigm based on principle components of animal and plant movement. This includes how the organism moves, when and towards what destination the movement occurs, why the organism moves and the interaction of these components. Establishing a unified theoretical framework for animal movement studies, that synthesizes different aspects of individual movement and general theory of animal movement research has resulted in a well-known and well-cited manuscript which provides a great baseline for anyone interested in animal movement ecology. </p>
